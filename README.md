# Agent Homelab

Agent Homelab turns one privacy-safe inventory into Traefik and Authelia configuration for a single host or a service host relayed through a separate edge gateway. It includes a Python CLI, a sanitized service catalog, guarded Borg backups, and seven agent skills for setup and operations.

## Supported topology

```text
Direct: Internet -> edge Traefik -> local service
Relay:  Internet -> edge Traefik -> service-host Traefik -> service
                         |
                         +-> Authelia for protected routes
```

A node can have `service_host`, `edge_gateway`, or both roles. LAN and existing Tailscale/WireGuard addresses are ordinary node addresses; Agent Homelab does not install a mesh VPN.

## Install

Python 3.11+, Docker Compose, and OpenSSH are supported on Linux.

```bash
python -m pip install \
  https://github.com/CochranResearchGroup/agent-homelab/releases/download/v0.2.0-rc.2/agent_homelab-0.2.0rc2-py3-none-any.whl
agent-homelab --version
```

For development:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## First setup

Create an ignored site inventory and inspect prerequisites:

```bash
agent-homelab init homelab.yaml --topology relay
agent-homelab doctor --inventory homelab.yaml
agent-homelab validate --inventory homelab.yaml
agent-homelab render --inventory homelab.yaml --output rendered
agent-homelab bootstrap --inventory homelab.yaml --node gateway --acme-email operator@example.invalid
```

Review the rendered node trees before deployment:

```bash
agent-homelab plan --inventory homelab.yaml --rendered rendered --node app-host
agent-homelab apply --inventory homelab.yaml --rendered rendered --node app-host --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only after the plan, destination, validation command, and rollback path are correct.

`bootstrap` is plan-only until `--apply` is provided. It creates persistent state directories and missing secret material without overwriting existing files. Use `recovery-bundle` to create a mode-`0600` non-secret recovery archive alongside encrypted backups of persistent state.

## Add a service

Keep each service in an operator-owned Docker Compose project directory and use it as the deployment authority. Portainer is available as an optional recipe for visibility or manual diagnostics, but it isn't the recommended control plane for agent-managed stacks.

```bash
agent-homelab recipe policy
agent-homelab service upsert photos \
  --inventory homelab.yaml \
  --upstream-node app-host \
  --port 2283 \
  --port-source 'compose.yaml IMMICH_PORT=2283' \
  --local-hostname photos.localhost \
  --public-hostname photos.example.net \
  --edge-node gateway \
  --auth-policy one_factor
```

Protected services render both the Traefik forward-auth middleware and a matching Authelia access-control rule. Route reachability and application proxy correctness remain separate validation gates.

## Inventory and secrets

Start from [`homelab.example.yaml`](homelab.example.yaml). Real `homelab.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.env`, OAuth state, ACME state, and rendered output are ignored. Inventory may contain secret references such as environment-variable names, but inline secret fields are rejected.

The schema is versioned. Use `agent-homelab migrate --inventory old.yaml --output homelab.yaml` to create a validated current inventory without overwriting the source.

## Agent skills

| Skill | Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `homelab-bootstrap` | Project start | Discover and bootstrap direct, combined, or relay topology |
| `homelab-service-catalog` | Build | Install catalog services with ingress and recovery boundaries |
| `homelab-service-ingress` | Operations | Add or change a service and verify proxy behavior |
| `homelab-borg-backup` | Operations | Configure, check, and stage restores from encrypted Borg backups |
| `homelab-maintenance` | Maintenance | Detect drift, validate health, and perform guarded upgrades |
| `homelab-oauth-relay` | Operations | Install and test the optional headless OAuth relay |
| `homelab-troubleshooter` | Runbook | Classify DNS, TLS, edge, auth, relay, origin, and app failures |

## V1 boundaries

V1 does not automate registrar DNS, install mesh VPNs, orchestrate SSH tunnels, deploy Kubernetes/Nomad, or provide a web control plane. It expects existing address reachability and explicit operator-owned secrets.

## Security

Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing services. Never file an issue containing inventory, credentials, callback URLs with authorization codes, or private network details.
